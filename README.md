  <h3 align="center">RunHacx Plugin</h3>
  <p align="center">[For Break The Code 2]</p>
</div>

## Introduction

The RunHacx.exe plugin is an advanced free and universal game trainer for the Break The Code 2 operating system. It is a tool for beginner Codebreakers who want the ability to use cheatcodes in the game. Since this is a research project it comes at a cost of no GUI and limited usability.

The **dynamic memory support** sets ugtrain apart. An integrated preloader, a memory discovery, and a memory hacking library are included for this. These also come with **automatic adaptation** for dynamic memory so that you can
use them right away on your system after executing it.

"_Neo who? You are the Hackerman now..._"

Note: This will not work on a local version of the OS, it needs a secure ssl tunnel to the https://breakthecode.tech server. 

## Getting Started

Clone the repository using the GitHub CLI in the Break The Code 2 Terminal & then simply follow the instructions to install the plugin.

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   gh repo clone breakthecode2/runhacx
   ```
2. Install the plugin
   ```sh
   install runhacx
   ```
3. Enjoy your new powers

> `install runhacx` will automatically search the OS system folders for the runhacx repository & would return an error if the repository isn't available in your client-side code.

## Basic Usage

Enter a cheatcode & runhacx will take care of the rest, tapping into the core system server it will execute the cheatcode & have the OS perform the mapped action.

Use the code `HACKERMAN` to get a 100 score boost.
